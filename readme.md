# Image Resizer
Use this tool to resize images to be 400 pixels by 400 pixels.

### Dependencies
This tool requires the Pillow library, which can be installed by the command: ```pip install Pillow```
To run this program, use the command: ```python Image-Resizer.py```
The program will require you to supply a path to an image. It is important to note that the image will be overwritten with the new dimensions. The image path can either be local to the current folder (ex: image.jpg), or can be the full file path (ex: C:\path\to\picture\picture.jpg).
